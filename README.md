This is a quiz tool that will help students and teachers to improve.
The provided code is a Python script that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for a quiz application using the Tkinter library and interacts with Google Sheets to fetch questions, allow users to answer them, and save the results.The script begins by importing necessary libraries to support its functionalities. The gspread library facilitates interaction with Google Sheets, while ServiceAccountCredentials enables authentication using a JSON key file. 
The random library is used for shuffling questions randomly, tkinter provides GUI components, messagebox is utilized for displaying messages, and re assists in working with regular expressions. After the library imports, the script configures access to Google Sheets. It defines the scope of access using URLs for feeds and Google Drive. It uses the ServiceAccountCredentials class to create credentials based on a provided JSON key file named ".json". These credentials are then used to authorize the client to access Google Sheets. 
This establishes the necessary connection to the spreadsheet.The script specifies the Google Sheets spreadsheet ID, which uniquely identifies the spreadsheet to work with. It then uses the client object to open the first sheet (sheet1) of the Google Sheet, making it ready for data manipulation. A function named get_questions is defined next. This function takes an argument num_questions, representing the number of questions to retrieve from the Google Sheet. Inside the function, all records from the sheet are fetched using the get_all_records method. The questions are shuffled randomly using the random.shuffle function. A subset of num_questions questions is selected from the shuffled list and returned, forming the selected questions for the quiz.
Another function, validate_email, is created to validate email addresses based on a regular expression pattern. The pattern ensures that the email format adheres to alphanumeric characters, plus signs, underscores, periods, and hyphens. This function returns a match object indicating whether the email is valid according to the pattern. Continuing, the start_quiz function is defined. This function is triggered when the user clicks the "Start Quiz" button in the GUI. It gathers user inputs such as email, student name, and quiz number from respective text entry fields. The email format is validated using the validate_email function and an error message is displayed using messagebox if the format is invalid. The number of quiz items is obtained from the GUI's input, and get_questions is called to retrieve the selected questions. A new window, named quiz_window, is created 
using Toplevel from Tkinter. The window is given a title "Quiz" and dimensions of 800x600 pixels. Inside the start_quiz function, a loop iterates through the selected questions. For each question, a label is created within the quiz_window to display the question's text. Additionally, a StringVar variable named answer_var is created with an initial value of "0". This variable will hold the user's answer choice for the current question. The answer choices for the current question are extracted from the Google Sheet data, and radio buttons are created using the Radiobutton widget from Tkinter. These radio buttons present the answer choices to the user, allowing them to select one. A "Submit" button is also added to the quiz_window. When clicked, this button triggers the submit_quiz function. The submit_quiz function processes the user's answers, calculates the score percentage, displays the quiz results using messagebox, and offers an option to retake the quiz. If the user chooses to retake the quiz, the start_quiz function is called again to reset the quiz.The evaluate_answers function is implemented to assess the user's answers against the correct answers. It takes two arguments: the list of questions and the user's answers. A loop iterates through the questions and compares each user answer to the corresponding correct answer in the questions data. If the answers match, the user's score is incremented. The total number of correct answers is returned.
The save_results_to_sheet2 function manages the process of saving the user's responses and results to the Google Sheet. It fetches the second sheet of the Google Sheet using get_worksheet(2), appends each user's data including email, student name, quiz number, selected question, user response, and correctness to a new row. Additionally, it appends the user's email and their score percentage as a final score in the same row. Finally, the main part of the script sets up the Tkinter GUI. Labels, text entry fields, and buttons are created using various Tkinter widgets. 
When the "Start Quiz" button is clicked, the start_quiz function is triggered, initializing the quiz-taking process. In summary, the provided code combines the power of the gspread library and Tkinter GUI framework to create a quiz application that  fetches questions from a Google Sheet, displays them to the user, evaluates their answers, and saves the results back to the same Google Sheet. This code demonstrates how Python can be used to create interactive and data-driven applications for educational purposes or beyond.
